### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Engineering Manager and developer with an interest in open-source.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on:

- https://github.com/openlawnz - a charity I co-founded
- https://github.com/williamparry/codespace-cms - a static site generator CMS using puppeteer and Github codespaces
- https://github.com/williamparry/GuildGrid - a collaborative grid you can use with just Discord

Happy to collaborate on anything interesting that will increase my skillset :)
