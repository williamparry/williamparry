### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm an Engineering Manager and developer with an interest in open-source.

ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on:

- https://github.com/openlawnz - a charity I co-founded
- https://github.com/williamparry/node-static-cms - a static site generator CMS using puppeteer and Git. Not sure where it'll go but the concept is neat

ğŸ‘¯ Happy to collaborate on anything interesting that will increase my skillset :)
